            </div>
            <p>PPCRC has always propagated ‘Innovation and Leadership’ as their mantra to bring 
                ground-breaking ideas and provide a rock solid foundation for learning. With the 
                vision and mission of providing quality education, the Institute is constructed by 
                world-renowned architects with its uniquely designed dome as its temple of

                <h2>President’s Note</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Education has to be taken to the masses; it needs to be rooted not in rote 
                learning but in a dynamic new pedagogy that fosters innovation and the leadership 
                mantra in each individual within the system. Flexibility and rapid adaptation to 
                the needs of the day have to be its hallmark if we are to fulfill our vision of a 
                ‘Shining India’. I truly believe that the priorities for our country are Health
                 and Education. I am grateful that we are one of the providers of these priorities.
                I am forever an idealist. To me, the spirit of nation building has to be at the
                core of our motivation if we are to break the shackles of age-old beliefs and
                responses. A vibrant, corruption-free India can only be built by a generation
                 that has learnt to cherish those values our country was known for. This 
                 vision is based on idealism. Our efforts are, we know, but a drop in the 
                 ocean. Yet, I also believe that every drop in the ocean counts and these 
                 efforts can come to a wonderful fruition. Confucius reminded us that the 
                 journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. We began with tiny 
                 steps, and look forward to this journey as an adventure in learning and 
                 creating. The way ahead can only get better.</p>
